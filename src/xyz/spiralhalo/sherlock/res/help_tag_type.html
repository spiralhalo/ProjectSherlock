Tags are used to mark activities that might not correspond directly to a specific project.
<p>There are two types of tags: supporting and general.</p>
<p><b>Supporting tags</b> mark activities that might be supportive to ongoing projects and therefore are counted towards your daily goal.</p>
<p><b>General tags</b> mark activities unrelated to any project and therefore aren't counted towards your daily goal.</p>
