Tag is a way to track activities that might not correspond directly to a specific project.
<p>There are two types of tag:</p>
<p><b>Supporting tag</b> adds towards your target and therefore should be used with productive activities.</p>
<p><b>General tag</b> does not add towards your target and therefore should be used with regular activities.</p>
