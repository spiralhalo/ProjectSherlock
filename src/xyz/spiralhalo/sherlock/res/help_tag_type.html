Tag is a way to track common activities outside of projects.
<p>There are two types of tag:<br>
    <b>&nbsp;- Supporting tag</b> adds towards your target and therefore should be used with productive activities.<br>
    <b>&nbsp;- General tag</b> does not add towards your target and therefore should be used with regular activities.<br>
</p>
<p>Tags are prioritized below projects so don't worry about using non-specific keywords for tags.</p>
